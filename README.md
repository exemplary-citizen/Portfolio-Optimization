# A Portfolio Design Problem
The returns on n = 4 assets are described by a Gaussian (normal) random vector r ∈ Rn , having the following expected value r and covariance matrix Σ:

The last asset corresponds to a risk-free investment. I attempt to design a portfolio mix with weights x ∈ Rn (each weight xi is non-negative, and the sum of the weights is one) so as to obtain the best possible expected return, while guaranteeing that:

(i) No single asset weighs more than 40%.
(ii) The risk-free assets should not weigh more than 20%.
(iii) No asset should weigh less than 5%.
(iv) The probability of experiencing a return lower than q = −1% should be no larger than ε = 10−4.
